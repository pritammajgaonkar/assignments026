# What Is the Cloud? 
*The cloud is made up of servers in data centers all over the world. 
Moving to the cloud can save companies money and add convenience for users.*

# How does cloud computing work?

*Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from 
applications to storage from a cloud service provider.
One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining
their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply pay for what they use, when they use it.
In turn, providers of cloud computing services can benefit from significant economies of scale by delivering the 
same services to a wide range of customers.*

# Advantages and Of Cloud Computing

### Cost Savings
*Cost saving is the biggest benefit of cloud computing. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not
need any physical hardware investments. Also, you do not need trained personnel to maintain the hardware. The buying
and managing of equipment is done by the cloud service provider.*

### Strategic edge
*Cloud computing offers a competitive edge over your competitors. It helps you to access the latest and applications any
time without spending your time and money on installations.*

### High Speed
*Cloud computing allows you to deploy your service quickly in fewer clicks. This faster deployment allows you to get
the resources required for your system within fewer minutes.*

### Back-up and restore data
*Once the data is stored in a Cloud, it is easier to get the back-up and recovery of that, which is otherwise very
time taking process on-premise.*

### Automatic Software Integration
*In the cloud, software integration is something that occurs automatically. Therefore, you don't need to take additional 
efforts to customize and integrate your applications as per your preferences.*

### Reliability
*Reliability is one of the biggest pluses of cloud computing. You can always get instantly updated about the changes.*

### Mobility
*Employees who are working on the premises or at the remote locations can easily access all the could services. 
All they need is an Internet connectivity.*

### Unlimited storage capacity
*The cloud offers almost limitless storage capacity. At any time you can quickly expand your storage capacity 
with very nominal monthly fees.*

### Collaboration
*The cloud computing platform helps employees who are located in different geographies to collaborate
in a highly convenient and secure manner.*

### Quick Deployment
*Last but not least, cloud computing gives you the advantage of rapid deployment. So, when you decide to use
the cloud, your entire system can be fully functional in very few minutes. Although, the amount of time taken depends on what kind of 
technologies are used in your business.*

# Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

### Performance Can Vary
*When you are working in a cloud environment, your application is running on the server which simultaneously provides resources to 
other businesses.Any greedy behavior or DDOS attack on your tenant could affect the performance of your shared resource.*

### Technical Issues
*Cloud technology is always prone to an outage and other technical issues. Even, the best cloud service provider companies may face
this type of trouble despite maintaining high standards of maintenance.*

### Security Threat in the Cloud
*Another drawback while working with cloud computing services is security risk. Before adopting cloud technology, you should be
well aware of the fact that you will be sharing all your company's sensitive information to a third-party cloud computing service
provider. Hackers might access this information.*

### Downtime
*Downtime should also be considered while working with cloud computing. That's because your cloud provider may face power loss,
low internet connectivity, service maintenance, etc.*

### Internet Connectivity
*Good Internet connectivity is a must in cloud computing. You can't access cloud without an internet connection.
Moreover, you don't have any other way to gather data from the cloud.*

### Lower Bandwidth
*Many cloud storage service providers limit bandwidth usage of their users. So, in case if your organization surpasses the given
allowance, the additional charges could be significantly costly,*

### Lacks of Support
*Cloud Computing companies fail to provide proper support to the customers. Moreover, they want their user to depend on FAQs or
online help, which can be a tedious job for non-technical persons.*
