>To verify that the script worked, enter the Hive Shell and run the following following queries. <br/>
>You should see daily stock prices and dividends from stocks that start with the letter K. <br/>

>Use gedit to create a new text in the labs/Lab7.4/ folder named join.hive. <br/>
>First, the result of the join is going to be put into the stock_aggregates table, which requires an insert. <br/>
>The result is going to contain the stock symbol, date traded, maximum high for the stock, minimum low, average <br/>
close, and the sum of dividends, as shown here. <br/>
>The from clause is the nyse_data table <br/>
>The join is going to be a left outer join of the dividends table <br/>
>The join is by stock symbol and trade date <br/>
>Letâ€™s group the result by symbol and trade date <br/>

>List the contents of the stock_aggregates directory in HDFS. The 000000_0 file was created as a result of the join query <br/>
>View the contents of the stock_aggregates table using the cat command. <br/>
